# snapchat-election-ad-data-predict-impressions
## Background Information
In this project, I am looking at __Spend__, __Age Range__, and __Run Time__. Spend refers to the amount (in USD) spent by the advertiser over the course of the campaign (from the start to the end date). Age Range refers to the ages that are being targeted in the advertisement. Run Time refers to how long the ad was run on the platform (from start to end date). 

### Business Question

## Data Sources
[Snapchat Political Ads Library] (https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/) provides open-source data for download. The data for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020 can be downloaded here (although I only focused on 2018 and 2020).
